# Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions and Fear on Tourist Satisfaction: A Comparative Analysis.
<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>R Programming</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Power BI</b>
- <b>Omnibus surveys</b>

<h2>Description of the project</h2>
This project aims to investigate the impact of changes in holiday plans caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on tourist satisfaction. Specifically, it seeks to understand whether tourists who modified their travel plans due to pandemic-related factors experienced differences in satisfaction. Two primary hypotheses are examined: first, that altering holiday plans may lead to dissatisfaction if expectations are not met, and second, that changing plans could enhance satisfaction by reducing the perceived risk of contagion. To achieve this, we conducted interviews (Omnibus survey) in 2020 (n= 2009) with tourists in a north Mediterranean coastal destination of Spain. To execute this research, a two-tiered methodology was employed, combining Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) with Non-parametric Analysis (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis).

<h3>Method 1: Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA)</h3>
The EFA technique is used to group the attributes effectively, not only to reduce the number of variables under consideration but also to propose relevant destination attribute items that can be categorized into commonly applicable groups.

<h3>Method 2: Non-parametric Analysis (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis)</h3>
The destination factors extracted earlier to investigate if tourists who had to change their holiday plans due to COVID-19 felt differently about their experience compared to those who didn't. We used two tests: the Mann-Whitney test to compare two groups and the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare more than two groups. These tests aid in figure out if there were significant differences in how satisfied people were depending on whether they had to change their plans or not.

<h3>Results</h3>

- Tourists who changed their destination due to COVID-19 were less satisfied.
- Tourists who changed their activities during their stay were more satisfied than those who didn't make any changes.
- Those who switched where they stayed were more satisfied with things like safety, the place itself, and the beaches.
-	People who changed the transportation type to reach their destination were happier with the price and quality.
-	Those who had shorter holidays than planned were less happy with safety compared to those who stayed longer.
-	Tourists were willing to adapt their plans to enjoy a holiday, despite the challenges.
-	Destination managers and tourism businesses had to balance safety measures and tourist happiness, which was sometimes tricky.
-	Tourist had to avoid measures that were too strict or too loose, which could lead to the virus spreading or unhappy visitors.
